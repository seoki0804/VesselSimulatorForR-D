## üìñ About The Project

**Vessel Simulator for R\&D** provides a controlled environment for researchers and developers to model and visualize vessel dynamics. Built predominantly with Python, it allows for the configuration of various parameters to test hypotheses and analyze outcomes efficiently, without the need for real-world maritime assets.

This tool aims to accelerate the research and development lifecycle in the maritime industry by offering a flexible and programmable simulation platform.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Vessel Simulation Core:** A robust engine to simulate the movement and behavior of vessels based on defined physical models.
  * **Configurable Parameters:** Easily modify vessel characteristics, environmental conditions, and simulation settings.
  * **Data Logging & Analysis:** (If applicable) Log simulation data for post-analysis and reporting using Python's data science capabilities.
  * **Extendable Modules:** (If applicable) Designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy extension and integration of new models or algorithms.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

This project is built primarily with Python and utilizes the following key technologies:

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need **Python 3.x** installed on your machine. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/seoki0804/VesselSimulatorForR-D.git
    cd VesselSimulatorForR-D
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install required packages**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(**Note**: If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file yet, you should create one by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing all your project's dependencies.)*

## üìñ Usage

To run the simulator:

```sh
python main.py
```

*(Replace `main.py` with the actual entry point of your Python application if it's different. Add more specific instructions on how to interact with your simulator here.)*
